                <h2 class="align-center">A Different Approach to Education Reform</h2>
                <p>We’ve all heard it before from students, “Time to cram for the test! Then afterwards I will forget
                    everything that we had just learned.” This is an approach most students take at their personal
                    education. Each class feels like a barrier that needs to be overcome. Once the mountain of barriers
                    have been scaled, that is when one can finally get started with their life. Admittedly, I too go
                    into most classes with the same attitude. Going from class to class with this mindset has felt
                    wrong. Shouldn’t school be a place for learning and growth? Not a place of unnecessary hurdles?
                    Going into writing this paper I have done a considerable amount of research on the idea. Initially I
                    supposed all the blame could be given to the traditional testing and grades that we have been using
                    for nearly a century.
                </p>
                <p>I have concluded testing and grades are actually a necessary way of measuring a students progress.
                    “This makes it easy for students to understand their grades and calculate the scores they need to
                    achieve the mark they desire(“Why letter grades”).” If the traditional methods of measuring a
                    students progress are necessary then how do we shift the students focus away from that measurement
                    and more towards really learning in the classroom. I believe there is a key aspect missing from
                    every classroom that, if added, will completely change a student's focus. That key aspect is there
                    is an insufficient instruction of WHY a student needs to learn each topic. Currently a high school
                    student is told to take a math class, an English class, a history class and a science class each
                    year. Why? Well to fulfill the requirement. </p>
                <p>What if at the beginning of each class instructors went through the benefits of taking their class.
                    “Students’ intrinsic motivation is evident when they desire to learn simply because it interests
                    them or they recognize the importance of learning(“Importance of high expectations”).” In math and
                    science we could help students understand that these classes are required to help them develop a
                    problem solving mind, learn how the world works around us, and to empower the student to use the
                    content taught to be used in the real world. Not just the classroom. The main concept behind this
                    concept is setting an expectation high enough to naturally motivate the student to learn because
                    they want to learn. Not because they need to get a good grade. Although that is necessary. </p>
                <p>Another aspect that needs to be emphasized is the importance of creating project based assignments
                    wherever possible rather than giving students busy work. Where possible this mode of learning will
                    move away from the mindset of memorize, then test. Naturally this will also help topics that usually
                    focus on teaching concepts move towards teaching applicable content. As said by a well respected
                    changemaker, Will Richardson, “Look, at the end of the day the only learning that really matters is
                    the learning that you can apply(Richardson).” Typically math classes are solely concept based with a
                    few application problems along the way. Imagine the benefits involved if an algebra student was
                    given a project to find objects around their house to then calculate the different equations it
                    would take to recreate the object on a graph. Sound complicated? Learning opportunities usually are
                    complex by nature which allow the student to experience the trial and error process of solving a
                    problem on their own.
                </p>
                <p>Personally, I teach an introduction to programming class at a local technology college and each
                    assignment is project based. Not a lot of time is spent lecturing the concept. To help the student
                    truly understand we give the student problems to apply what they have learned. Not just that but
                    each lesson builds on top of the other. This allows the student to naturally learn a skill. In the
                    traditional classroom students often must memorize concepts that are difficult to relate to each
                    other. Lesson after lesson students must do this. Truly grasping knowledge is difficult in such a
                    mode.
                </p>
                <p>Lastly, if we are able to move to a project based style of learning. Most assignments could now be
                    considered pass/fail. “There is no such thing as a C or a D for a lazily written term paper. There
                    is no failing. The only goal is to learn the material.(Spenver).” Instead a standard is set for each
                    project and the student either sufficiently meets the criteria or does not. This would encourage
                    students to give their best work. There will no longer be the option to settle for less.
                </p>
                <p>Some critiques may say that school has been around for a long time and has evolved into something
                    that works best for our day today. In contrast I would say that society is forever evolving and the
                    education system simply is not evolving fast enough to remain relevant. To keep the education system
                    relevant it must also continue to evolve as we continue to progress as a society.
                </p>
                <p>In conclusion, I do not believe that the current system is a failing system. I simply believe, like
                    any good thing, the education system can make great improvements if the individual student is the
                    main focus. A higher standard needs to be set. Not a standard based on the grades a student achieves
                    but a standard that elevates and empowers a student to really truly learn. Not earn grades. But to
                    earn knowledge. In the words of Einstein, “Try not to become a man of success but rather try to
                    become a man of value.”

                <p>Hello! Welcome to my website all about education reform! This site is intended to be both informative
                    and encourage you as the reader to do your own research on the topic. All of the writings that you

                    2010 at Salt Lake Community College. You will find three different articles on this site. The first

                <p>My foot tapped on the hard tiled floor faster than humanly possible. It feels as if time is speeding
                    up as I stand here in line. The cafeteria is so noisy. Yet, I can’t hear anyone. My mind instead is
                    overwhelmed with math equations I need to remember. Next period I have a math final to take and
                    that's all I have been able to think about. So much is riding on this one moment.

                <h2>The History of Education Reform</h2>
                <p>Humans are naturally very adaptive and innovative creatures. Since the beginning of human history we
                    have been getting better at teaching each other to survive and to adapt to our environment. Many
                    years ago school was once a hunting lesson. To learn how to survive. Over many years we have become
                    so advanced that hunting is not the main lesson to be taught. Instead we teach each other how to
                    build tall structures, how to manipulate complicated data, how we can learn from the great lessons
                    of the past, and so much more! With this innovation there is much competition on who can create the
                    best environment for people to learn in. In recent years...</p>
