                <h2 class="align-center">Finals Week</h2>
                <p>My foot tapped on the hard tiled floor faster than humanly possible. It feels as if time is speeding
                    up as I stand here in line. The cafeteria is so noisy. Yet, I can’t hear anyone. My mind instead is
                    overwhelmed with math equations I need to remember. Next period I have a math final to take and
                    that's all I have been able to think about. So much is riding on this one moment.
                </p>
                <p>“Hey you’re up!” A voice came behind me.</p>
                <p>Quickly I snapped out of the calculus nightmare. I glanced at the food options which sat on foam
                    trays. Without much thought I chose a chicken sandwich, grabbed some ketchup and mayonnaise and
                    called it good. I picked up the tray and started walking towards the commons area.</p>
                <p>Before I knew it I was at the table my friends and I always sat at and I took a seat.</p>
                <p>My friends all sat at the circular table in silence staring at notebooks that had been worn out
                    through the current school year.</p>
                <p>“How are you guys feeling about your tests?” I asked.</p>
                <p>Jake looked up from his notebook and responded, “Pretty good. Luckily my teachers gave us all study
                    guides of what is going to be on the tests. So in theory I should do fine.”</p>
                <p>Myles pitched in, “Yeah my history teacher gave us a packet that has 50 questions to answer. He said
                    20 of those questions will be our final. You already know I have that packet memorized now!”
                </p>
                <p>Laughing, I said, “Funny how much time our teachers spend making sure we do well on our
                    tests(Engleman).” </p>
                <p>“Hey I am all for it! Helps me get those good grades. Need to keep the grades up high so I can get
                    some good scholarships!” Myles said.</p>
                <p>We all nodded in agreement. Totally changing the subject we talked about everything else that was
                    going on in our lives for the remainder of lunch.</p>
                <p>“DING! DING! DING!” Rang the bell.</p>
                <p>My heart dropped. Even though I was prepared for this test there was a lot on the line. I got up and
                    threw away the foam tray. Slowly I made my way to B-hall. After making my way through the sea of
                    students I took one last breath before entering class. I just needed to trust that I got this.
                    Studying all day yesterday will certainly pay off. And with that thought I walked into class ready
                    to take on what was in front of me.</p>

                <p>Hello! Welcome to my website all about education reform! This site is intended to be both informative
                    and encourage you as the reader to do your own research on the topic. All of the writings that you

                <h2>The History of Education Reform</h2>
                <p>Humans are naturally very adaptive and innovative creatures. Since the beginning of human history we
                    have been getting better at teaching each other to survive and to adapt to our environment. Many
                    years ago school was once a hunting lesson. To learn how to survive. Over many years we have become
                    so advanced that hunting is not the main lesson to be taught. Instead we teach each other how to
                    build tall structures, how to manipulate complicated data, how we can learn from the great lessons
                    of the past, and so much more! With this innovation there is much competition on who can create the
                    best environment for people to learn in. In recent years...</p>

                <h2>A Different Approach to Education Reform</h2>
                <p>We’ve all heard it before from students, “Time to cram for the test! Then afterwards I will forget
                    everything that we had just learned.” This is an approach most students take at their personal
                    education. Each class feels like a barrier that needs to be overcome. Once the mountain of barriers
                    have been scaled, that is when one can finally get started with their life. Admittedly, I too go
                    into
                    most classes with the same attitude...</p>
