                <h2 style="margin-top: -50px;" class="align-center">The History of Education Reform</h2>
                <p>Humans are naturally very adaptive and innovative creatures. Since the beginning of human history we
                    have been getting better at teaching each other to survive and to adapt to our environment. Many
                    years ago school was once a hunting lesson. To learn how to survive. Over many years we have become
                    so advanced that hunting is not the main lesson to be taught. Instead we teach each other how to
                    build tall structures, how to manipulate complicated data, how we can learn from the great lessons
                    of the past, and so much more! With this innovation there is much competition on who can create the
                    best environment for people to learn in. In recent years the United States education system has had
                    much attention drawn to it as a system that may be falling behind compared to its competition.
                </p>
                <p>In the 1970’s this was a topic that started to gain some traction in the United States Federal
                    Government. Many worried that the United States no longer was producing the best of the best from
                    its education system. What came forth was a movement called, “Back to Basics.”(Education Reform
                    Timeline) As this movement gained traction many states implemented a “minimum competency test to
                    assure that high school students master basic reading, writing and math skills.”(Education Reform
                    Timeline) Around the same time the Federal Government took their own action and implemented
                    standardized tests to better measure school performance (Education Reform Timeline). These reforms
                    started a movement that continues on to this day.</p>
                <p>For the next 30 years the movement to improve the education system will gain a lot of traction. By
                    2002 President George W. Bush took matters into his own hands by signing the No Child Left Behind
                    Act. The idea behind this act was a standard would be made for each state that each student would
                    need to hit in math and reading. To accomplish this goal many standardized tests were created to
                    measure each state's growth. With these tests, some schools' overall funding became attached to the
                    students test results. Putting teachers' jobs on the line if their students were not passing. A
                    direct consequence of this was changing the curriculum in classrooms to be more of a testing study
                    group rather than to really learn and understand the material(Klein).</p>
                <p>States started to take action into their own hands and create what we now know today as “Common
                    Core.” Common Core was a curriculum developed to help students come out on top. The main takeaway
                    was that everyone would have the same curriculum. Math and English would be taught the same way in
                    every single classroom. Once put into practice it was determined after a few years that students
                    were not improving. In fact “low-performing students, who were supposed to benefit most, especially
                    struggled.”(Goldstein)</p>
                <p>Many states argued that this shift in curriculum was a negative impact on the education system which
                    resulted in those states undoing Common Core from their curriculum. After nearly a decade of mass
                    testing from the federal government President Obama signed the “Every Student Succeeds
                    Act.”(Williams) The purpose of this act was to completely rewrite the prior “No Child Left Behind
                    Act.” More power was given to the states to determine the best approach to measure
                    success(Williams). </p>
                <p>At the time of this writing the Every student Succeeds Act is still the active law in effect for the
                    American Education System. This law continues to have a focus on testing to measure the progress of
                    students, schools, and overall each state. Along with creating academic standards, each state must
                    create a plan that involves “helping disadvantaged students”. Including students who are, in
                    poverty, a minority, receive special education services, and have limited English language skills.
                </p>
                <p>Today school systems have been encountering a large amount of change in the recent pandemic. All
                    schools were forced to move to an online classroom which brought on a learning curve for all.
                    Schools had to adapt quickly with very little notice. Since the schools were not prepared to move to
                    an online classroom many schools offered students to accept a “P” on their transcript rather than to
                    be given a normal letter grade. This “P” stands for “Pass.” If a student had at least a D- they
                    could opt in to get a “P” instead. Creating a wrinkle in the traditional mode of grading. Many
                    wonder what the long term effects the pandemic and online learning will have on the current
                    generation of students. Will colleges accept a “P” on a students transcript?</p>
                <p>All in all, one must ask themselves whether or not the education system is moving in a positive
                    direction. Are the changes to have more standardized testing helping the individual student? What
                    can we learn from the recent pandemic going forward? Should we make more changes and encourage
                    education reform? Or is the current system the best system for our time?

                <p>Hello! Welcome to my website all about education reform! This site is intended to be both informative
                    and encourage you as the reader to do your own research on the topic. All of the writings that you
                    will find on this site were researched, written and revised as I (Brayden Lemke) was taking English
                    2010 at Salt Lake Community College. You will find three different articles on this site. The first
                    takes the mode of a flash memoir...

                <h2>Finals Week</h2>
                <p>My foot tapped on the hard tiled floor faster than humanly possible. It feels as if time is speeding
                    up as I stand here in line. The cafeteria is so noisy. Yet, I can’t hear anyone. My mind instead is
                    overwhelmed with math equations I need to remember. Next period I have a math final to take and
                    that's all I have been able to think about. So much is riding on this one moment.

                <h2>A Different Approach to Education Reform</h2>
                <p>We’ve all heard it before from students, “Time to cram for the test! Then afterwards I will forget
                    everything that we had just learned.” This is an approach most students take at their personal
                    education. Each class feels like a barrier that needs to be overcome. Once the mountain of barriers
                    have been scaled, that is when one can finally get started with their life. Admittedly, I too go
                    into
                    most classes with the same attitude...</p>
