				<h2 class="align-center">Editors Note</h2>
				<p>Hello! Welcome to my website all about education reform! This site is intended to be both informative
					and encourage you as the reader to do your own research on the topic. All of the writings that you
					will find on this site were researched, written and revised as I (Brayden Lemke) was taking English
					2010 at Salt Lake Community College. You will find three different articles on this site. The first
					takes the mode of a flash memoir. This memoir is a memory that sets the tone of how I personally
					feel about education reform. Many ideas will be brought up that are typically heard from students in
					high school or college.
				</p>
				<p>The second article you will find is a research paper about the history of education reform that is
					strictly informative. Reading over this writing will give you general knowledge of relevant actions
					that have been taken in the past 50 years to reform the education system. At the very end of the
					article I give you some questions to consider to help you form your own opinion on whether or not
					education reform is necessary and/or have past actions been positive or negative for the overall
					system.</p>
				<p>Lastly, in the third article I give you my proposed plan to improve education as a whole. I go over
					some of the research that I have conducted on this topic and the conclusion that I have come to at
					this time. I then give 3 principles that I believe, if implemented properly, will have a huge impact
					on education as we know it. The goal of this article is to convince those who have the power to make
					large changes to implement reform that includes these principles as the focus.</p>
				<p>After reading each of these articles I would hope that it sparks some familiarity as when you have
					gone to school and felt the same feelings that I have. The overall idea is that school should feel
					like a place to learn and to grow. To gain knowledge to better the world we live in. Instead it
					feels like a bunch of tests that need to be taken. Once the test has been taken the content learned
					is then forgotten. Overall education feels like a roadblock that must be overcome to be considered
					for well paying jobs.</p>
				I would love it if action was taken to shift the focus in the classroom away from tests and busy work.
				Instead the goal is to have classrooms that teach applicable content which students understand are
				important concepts to learn. Without students understanding the end goal of learning in any given
				subject there is no motivation to retain what is taught. Overall, I really hope you enjoy exploring this
				topic with me! I spent a lot of time writing and researching. If this topic interests you, be sure to do
				your own research and share your thoughts with your friends!

				<h2>Finals Week</h2>
				<p>My foot tapped on the hard tiled floor faster than humanly possible. It feels as if time is speeding
					up as I stand here in line. The cafeteria is so noisy. Yet, I can’t hear anyone. My mind instead is
					overwhelmed with math equations I need to remember. Next period I have a math final to take and
					that's all I have been able to think about. So much is riding on this one moment.

				<h2>The History of Education Reform</h2>
				<p>Humans are naturally very adaptive and innovative creatures. Since the beginning of human history we
					have been getting better at teaching each other to survive and to adapt to our environment. Many
					years ago school was once a hunting lesson. To learn how to survive. Over many years we have become
					so advanced that hunting is not the main lesson to be taught. Instead we teach each other how to
					build tall structures, how to manipulate complicated data, how we can learn from the great lessons
					of the past, and so much more! With this innovation there is much competition on who can create the
					best environment for people to learn in. In recent years...</p>

				<h2>A Different Approach to Education Reform</h2>
				<p>We’ve all heard it before from students, “Time to cram for the test! Then afterwards I will forget
					everything that we had just learned.” This is an approach most students take at their personal
					education. Each class feels like a barrier that needs to be overcome. Once the mountain of barriers
					have been scaled, that is when one can finally get started with their life. Admittedly, I too go
					into
					most classes with the same attitude...</p>
