                <p>Hello! Welcome to my website all about education reform! This site is intended to be both informative
                    and encourage you as the reader to do your own research on the topic. All of the writings that you
                    will find on this site were researched, written and revised as I (Brayden Lemke) was taking English
                    2010 at Salt Lake Community College. You will find three different articles on this site. The first
                    takes the mode of a flash memoir...

                <h2>Finals Week</h2>
                <p>My foot tapped on the hard tiled floor faster than humanly possible. It feels as if time is speeding
                    up as I stand here in line. The cafeteria is so noisy. Yet, I can’t hear anyone. My mind instead is
                    overwhelmed with math equations I need to remember. Next period I have a math final to take and
                    that's all I have been able to think about. So much is riding on this one moment.

                <h2>The History of Education Reform</h2>
                <p>Humans are naturally very adaptive and innovative creatures. Since the beginning of human history we
                    have been getting better at teaching each other to survive and to adapt to our environment. Many
                    years ago school was once a hunting lesson. To learn how to survive. Over many years we have become
                    so advanced that hunting is not the main lesson to be taught. Instead we teach each other how to
                    build tall structures, how to manipulate complicated data, how we can learn from the great lessons
                    of the past, and so much more! With this innovation there is much competition on who can create the
                    best environment for people to learn in. In recent years...</p>

                <h2>A Different Approach to Education Reform</h2>
                <p>We’ve all heard it before from students, “Time to cram for the test! Then afterwards I will forget
                    everything that we had just learned.” This is an approach most students take at their personal
                    education. Each class feels like a barrier that needs to be overcome. Once the mountain of barriers
                    have been scaled, that is when one can finally get started with their life. Admittedly, I too go
                    into
                    most classes with the same attitude...</p>
